# Binary and Logic practice

To warm up, you will be converting integers between different bases and from
`ASCII` and `binary` in the `1-base-conversions` directory. Following this, test
your logic skills by filling out some truth tables in the `2-truthTables`
directory. 

This is a great opportunity to practice solving these types of problems
programmatically. There are helper functions in some of the files in order to
keep each function aligned with the Single Responsibility Principle. You'll also
notice a `utils` directory that contains two modules that are imported into some
of the problem files. Read through the comments in order to understand how
they're being used, or how they can be used within your own function
definitions.

Before starting each problem take a couple of minutes to discuss a plan of
action with your pair.

Problems can be found [here][binary logic].

## Learning Goals

* Translate between base-10 (decimal), base-2 (binary) and base-16
  (hexadecimal) integers
* Translate between hexadecimal and ASCII
* Construct the truth table for core logic expressions:
  * and, or, not, xor
* Construct a truth table for compound logic expressions
