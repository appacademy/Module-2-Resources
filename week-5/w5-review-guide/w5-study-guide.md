# **Topics to know for multiple choice:**

## **Big O of operations with Single and Double Linked Lists:**

-   **Single linked:**

    > H[1] => [2] => T[3] => null

    -   Add to head: O(1) time | O(1) space
    -   add to tail: _with_ tail pointer O(1) time | _without_ tail pointer O(n) time | space O(1)
    -   remove from tail: O(n) time | O(1) space
    -   remove from head: O(1)time | O(1) space
    -   find = O(n)

-   **Double Linked:**

    > null <<= H[1] <=> [2] <=> T[3] =>> null

    -   add to head: O(1) time | O(1) space
    -   add to tail: O(1) time | O(1) space
    -   remove from tail: O(1) time
    -   remove from head: O(1) time
    -   find: O(n)

-   Relative Advantages:
    -   LL > DLL:
        -   less memory
        -   simpler code
    -   DLL > LL
        -   Improved time complexity for removeFromTail (when LL lacks a tail pointer)
        -   previous pointer (makes removing nodes much easier)

## **Describe an indexed location in memory**

-   _Memory address_ === _memory pointer_ === _memory reference_ all refer to an indexed location in memory.
-   Memory can be thought of as a long strip of cells that can be electrically charged. Each cell is divided into chunks called _words_ that are the default data size for the given processor (64 bit architecture === 64 bit words).
-   Each _word_ is indexed by its **memory address that acts as a pointer to indicate where the data is stored in memory.**

---

## **Understand the functionality of methods on Lists, Stacks and Queues:**

**Lists**

-   Single Linked (_without a tail pointer_):

    -   **addToHead():**
        -   create a new node, point the new node's next to the current head.
        -   reassign the current head to the new node.
    -   **addTo Tail():**
        -   create a new node, point the current tail's next to the new node - reassign the current tail to the new node.
    -   **removeFromHead():**
        -   set the new head to the current head's next pointer
    -   **removeFromTail():**
        -   iterate through all of the nodes until we find a node with a next.next property that is equal to null.
        -   set the that current node's next property to null.

**Stacks**:

-   We know that stacks are **L**ast in **F**irst out (**LIFO**), or also, **F**irst in **L**ast out (**FILO**) so their methods will follow this pattern.

    -   **push():** _Add_ something to the _end_ (or the _top_) of the stack.
    -   **pop():** _Remove_ something from the _end_ (or the _top_) of the stack

**Queues:**

-   We know that queues are **F**irst in **F**irst out (**FIFO**), or, **L**ast in **L**ast out (**LILO**).

    -   **Enqueue():** _Add_ something to the _back_, or _end_, of the list.
    -   **Dequeue():** _Remove_ something from the _head_ or the _front_ of the queue.

## Be able to convert characters from Binary to ASCII, Hexadecimal, base10 and back:

> See conversions.js

-   **parseInt(_string_, _radix_):**
    -   Converts it's first argument to a string, parses that string, and returns an integer or NaN.
    -   Binary base (radix) = 2
    -   Decimal base (radix) = 10
    -   Hexadecimal base (radix) = 16
-   **Obj.toString(_\*radix_):**
    -   returns a string representing the object
    -   For _Numbers_ and _BigInt_ method takes an optional _radix_ argument.
        -   This allows you to convert base 10 numbers to another base
-   **String.fromCharCode(...nums):**
    -   nums = a sequence of numbers that are (UTF-16) 16 bits or 2 octets wide (i.e.: 83, 72, 73, 84).
        -   Range is 0 - 65535.
    -   Returns: a string
-   **str.charCodeAt(index):**
    -   _index:_ A number >= 0 and < then the length of the input str.
        -   If index given is not a number it defaults to 0.
    -   Returns a number representing the UTF-16 value of the character at the given index (i.e.: 70, 85, 67, 75)
        -   if index is out of range, return NaN

---

## Be able to look at a piece of code and determine the BigO time complexity:

1. Example:

```js
// time O(1)
function pusher(arr) {
    for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        console.log(arr.push(i));
    }
}
```

2. Example:

```js
// time O(n)
function unshifter(arr) {
    for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        console.log(arr.unshift(i));
    }
}
```

3. Example:

```js
// time O(n)
function doubleFor(arr) {
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        console.log('lol');
    }
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        console.log('lol again');
    }
}
```

4.  Example:

```js
// time O(n^2)
function doubleFor(arr) {
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < arr.length; j++) {
            console.log('lol again');
        }
        console.log('lol');
    }
}
```

## BigO time complexity of methods on a dynamic array:

-   **pop():**

    -   time O(1) - space O(1)
    -   removing an element of the end, we don't have to iterate because the array keeps the array's length as meta data.

-   **push():**

    -   time O(1) - space O(1)
    -   Because dynamic arrays are over-allocated with additional memory spaces, adding something to the end of the array fills a slot in memory that was already allocated.
    -   worst case scenario, the array has to resize, which would make the push an O(n) time and space. But because it happens so infrequently, we consider push an O(1)

-   **shift():**

    -   time O(n) - space O(1)
    -   it is O(n) because when we remove an element from the front of the array, all of the other elements have to shift to the left.

-   **unshift():**

    -   time O(n) - space O(1)
    -   it is O(n) because when we add to the front of an array, all of the elements must first move to the right one space.

-   **indexOf():**

    -   time O(n) - space O(1)
    -   because it must iterate through each element to find the element you are searching for.

-   **reverse():**

    -   time O(n) - space O(1)
    -   O(n) for time complexity since it requires you to copy each element in the array, and changes their indexes

-   **[...arr]:**

    -   time O(n) - space O(n)
    -   O(n) for time because it has to copy each element in the original array into the new array
    -   O(n) for space because it's copying each element from the original array into a new array.

-   **reduce():**

    -   time O(n) - space O(1) or O(n) (depending on your accumulator)
    -   Time is 0(n) because it must iterate through the given array
    -   Space O(1) when the accumulator is an integer.
    -   space O(n) when the accumulator is an array or pojo.

-   **filter():**

    -   time O(n) - space O(n)
    -   time because it iterates through the given array
    -   space because it creates a new array with all of the true values.

-   **map():**

    -   time O(n) - space O(n)
    -   time because it iterates through the given array
    -   space because it creates a new array with all of the new values.

-   **forEach():**

    -   time O(n) - space O(1)
    -   time because it iterates through the given array

-   **slice():**

    -   time O(n) - space O(n)
    -   it has to iterate through the given indices
    -   it creates a new array to copy the selected elements

-   **splice()**
    -   time O(n) - space O(n)
    -   It has to iterate through the given index and amount

## Know when hash table collisions occur:

-   A hash table collision occurs when the hashMod function returns the same index for two different given keys.
-   One of the ways of resolving a collision is by increasing the size of the hash table (increase the size of the underlying array).
-   Probability of a collision is (1 / buckets.length )
    -   Each slot (index) in the array is called a "bucket".
-   **Load Factor** === the number of key/value pairs divided by the number of "buckets".
-   Generally, most languages resize when the load factor === 0.7.
    -   This reduces the probability of collisions while minimizing wasted space.
-   Example of code used for dynamically resizing hash tables in javascript that can be added to top of insert() method:

```js
if (this.count / this.capacity > 0.7) {
    this.resize();
}
```

## Know how many bits make up various sizes of memory:

-   **bytes:**

    -   kilo - 1,000
    -   mega - 1,000,000
    -   giga - 1,000,000,000
    -   terra - 1,000,000,000,000
    -   peta - 1,000,000,000,000,000

-   **bits:**
    -   kilo - 8,000
    -   mega - 8,000,000
    -   giga - 8,000,000,000
    -   terra - 8,000,000,000,000
    -   peta - 8,000,000,000,000,000

---

## Know the BigO Time complexity of operations in a hash table:

-   resize
    -   time O(n) (space O(n))
-   read
    -   time O(1) for key lookup, O(n) for value lookup if linked list was used to handle hash collisions.
-   insert
    -   time O(1)
-   delete
    -   time O(1)
-   hash
    -   time O(1)

---

## Know the space complexities of the data structures learned this week:

-   queues:
    -   O(n)
-   linked list:
    -   O(n)
-   stack:
    -   O(n)
-   hash table:
    -   O(n)
-   Recursive Functions = O(n)

> Example: Which function has a worse **space** complexity?

```js
function first(n) {
    if (n < 0) return;

    console.log(n);

    first(n - 1);
}

function second(n) {
    arr = [];

    for (let i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        arr.unshift(i);
    }

    console.log(arr.join('\n'));
}
// They are both the same.
```

## Know the properties of an array:

**Static Arrays:**

1. Sequence of elements of the same type stored in contiguous block of memory.
2. Size needs to be declared during instantiation.
3. Stores elements in sequential order

# Things to know for coding portion:

## Implement a queue or a linked list:

-   You should have an implementation you wrote this week that you can use.

```js
class Node {
	constructor(val) {
		this.next = null;
		this.value = val;
	}
}

class Queue {
	constructor() {
		this.head = null;
		this.tail = null;
		this.length = 0;
	}

	enqueue(val) {
		let newNode = new SinglyLinkedNode(val);
		if (!this.length) {
			this.head = newNode;
			this.tail = newNode;
		} else {
			this.tail.next = newNode;
			this.tail = newNode;
		}
		this.length++;
		return this.length;
	}

	dequeue() {
		let removed = this.head;
		if (!this.length) return null;
		if (this.length === 1) {
			this.head = null;
			this.tail = null;
		} else {
			this.head = removed.next;
		}
		this.length--;
		return removed.value;
	}
}
```

## Make sure you know the properties of each:

**Sets:**

-   **.add()** ~> arr.push()
-   **.has()** ~> arr.includes()
-   **.delete()** ~> arr.splice()
-   **.forEach()** ~> arr.forEach()

**queue:**

-   **enqueue()** ~> arr.push()
-   **dequeue** ~> arr.shift()

## Be able to convert hexadecimal to ascii characters and return strings:

-   **Hexadecimal to ASCII:**

```js
function hexToASCII(hexStr) {
	let converted = '';
	for (let i = 0; i < hexStr.length; i += 2) {
		let hex = hexStr.slice(i, i + 2);
		let decOfHex = parseInt(hex, 16);
		converted += String.fromCharCode(decOfHex);
	}
	return converted;
}

// console.log(hexToASCII("736F667477617265")); // => software
```

-   **Hexadecimal Array to ASCII:**

```js
function arrHexToASCII(hexArr) {
	let converted = '';
	hexArr.forEach((word) => {
		for (let i = 0; i < word.length; i += 2) {
			let hex = word.slice(i, i + 2);
			let decOfHex = parseInt(hex, 16);
			converted += String.fromCharCode(decOfHex);
		}
		converted += ' ';
	});
	return converted;
}

// console.log(arrHexToASCII(['61707061636164656d79', '70726f626c656d', '736f6c76696e67'])) // => appacademy problem solving
```
