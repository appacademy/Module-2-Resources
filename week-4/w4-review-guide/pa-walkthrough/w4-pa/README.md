# TDD and OOP practice assessment

Clone the GitHub repository from the button below.

In this practice assessment, you will be implementing a vehicle review system
based solely on test specs and your TDD/OOP skills. By the end of this practice
assessment, a vehicle tester will be able to submit reviews for different types
of vehicles. The reviews will be stored within the correct tester and vehicle
instances for each specific review.

Read the specs carefully to understand the requirements and file
structure of the project. Everything you need to know is there.

1. `npm install` to install Mocha and Chai
2. `npm test` to run the test cases


A few notes:

- This assessment focuses primarily on TDD and OOP. However, you should be
  prepared to apply any of the skills you learned in Module 1, specifically
  working with objects and advanced array methods. Make sure you are comfortable
  with all of the skills highlighted in the spec descriptions.

- The test specs for this practice assessment are organized by _skill_, not by
  class. As a result, you will need to move around across different files and classes as you
  work through the specs. You may find that your code for a specific method passes a basic spec
  early on, but you may need to add more code to that method later in the
  practice assessment to pass additional specs.

- The assertions within the test specs highlight the specific methods and
  attribute names that will be used in the tests. However, you are not limited
  to _only_ using those attributes and methods. Feel free to create additional
  helper methods and/or attributes to help you pass the specs and keep your code DRY.
