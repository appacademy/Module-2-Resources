/*
Single Responsibility Principle: Do one thing and do it well

SRP refers to the idea that a function or class or method should be responsible
for just as much functionality as is necessary...no more, no less.

An example is given in your reading using a JavaScript class (that you will
learn about tomorrow). The class Book should only contain the properties and
methods that pertain to descriptions and behaviors of a book.

The second class SimplePrinter that was created later holds the
descriptors(properties) and the behaviors related to printing some type of
object.

Following the guidelines of SRP sets up easier to read code that just makes more
sense.

/*
DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself:

Making code that is more readable and more reusable should be every programmer's
goal. By taking a critical look at your code and identifying places where you
may have identical logic repeated throughout and creating smaller, more reusable
functions or methods to contain that logic, allows you to write code that other
programmers will be able to follow more closely and accurately, leading to
maintainable code.



The opposite of DRY coding is, of course, WET. We Enjoy Typing.
